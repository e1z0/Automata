**Automate** is the Simple Easy to use Management Tool for Microsoft Windows

You can do various simple tasks with it, for example flush dns entries, enable guest smb sharing, change network card mac address, edit hosts file, clean temp & internet storage, cleanup update backups, scan system files, check system health, disable uac and many more...

The application is under development but current functions properly! We add visual functions when we test it and everything works fine.

**NOTE! For Windows 10 Users** Please run this app in administrator mode to work properly!

Here are few app screenshots:
